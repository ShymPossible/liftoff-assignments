OVERVIEW:

Body-Aware increases the user’s body-awareness by enabling them to log, track, comprehend, and share bodily symptoms they’re experiencing with their selected practitioners in real time. From specialists to personal physicians, Body-Aware provides comprehensive feedback on a patients’ day-to-day condition by leading users through guided questions to filter down and express their symptoms using “type”, “location”, and “intensity”. Body-Aware creates interactive data for both left (graphs) and right (color overlays over body image) brain interpretation. No more long doctor’s visits or symptom sheets to fill out, Body Aware not only clears the communication lines ahead of time between user and practitioner, but encourages and enables users to become more aware of their bodies by tracking their symptoms with them. There’s no catch, use the app, track your own data, however and whenever you want. You decide the depth, scope, and frequency of your logging—and you decide who you share your data with every step of the way!

FEATURES:

User Login— Users will be able to create an account and login to their profile within the app.

Symptom Log— Users will be able to submit custom symptoms based on prompts for “location”, “type”, and “intensity”. The user is able to choose the names and color representations of each symptom.

Data Compilation/Interpretation— Users can choose between body-map and graph style data interpretations on their own entered or data share with them, and filter said data with keywords like time-frame, location, frequency, color, intensity.

Find a Physician— Users will be able to search the yelp business API to find physicians near them based on zip code and keyword.

Profile Share and Chat— Users can invite other users to see filtered data and engage in private chats in a remote shared page customized by the inviting user.

WHAT I’LL HAVE TO LEARN:

To complete this project I’m learning the MEAN stack. I’m also learning to implement CSS Grid and Bootstrap for front-end styling. Finally, I’ll have to learn how to table users to create custom drag/drop shapes that can be saved to MongoDB, retrieved with their same functionality at any time, and edited at any time.
