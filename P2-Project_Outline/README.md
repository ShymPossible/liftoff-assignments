# **OVERVIEW - _Body-Aware App_:**

Body-Aware enables users to log, track, comprehend, and share bodily symptoms they’re experiencing with their selected practitioners in real-time. From specialists to personal physicians, Body-Aware provides comprehensive feedback on a patients’ day-to-day condition by leading users through guided questions, filtering down their symptoms using “type”, “location”, and “intensity”. Body-Aware creates interactive data for both left (graphs) and right (color overlays over body image) brain interpretation. No more long doctor’s visits or symptom sheets to fill out, Body Aware not only clears the communication lines ahead of time between user and practitioner, but encourages and enables users to become more aware of their bodies by tracking their symptoms with them. There’s no catch, use the app, track your own data, however and whenever you want. You decide the depth, scope, and frequency of your logging—and you decide who you share your data with every step of the way!

### **WHAT I’LL HAVE TO LEARN:**

To complete this project I’m learning the MERN stack. I’m also learning to implement CSS Grid and Bootstrap for front-end styling. Finally, I’ll have to learn to create custom drag/drop shapes that can be saved to MongoDB, retrieved with their same functionality at any time, and edited at any time by the logged-in user.
